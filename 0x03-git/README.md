## Description
We learned and practised the principles of git, git commands, remote repositories with a focus on github, collaborations, branching, and advanced subjects like git hooks and rebase.

## Basic Concepts
- **Repository (Repo):** A collection of files and their revision history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of a repository allowing for separate lines of development.
- **Merge:** Combining changes from different branches.

## Git Commands
- `git init:` Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone:` Create a copy of a remote repository.
- `git add:` Add changes to the staging area.
- `git commit:` Record changes to the repository.
- `git pull:` Fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them.
- `git push:` Update a remote repository with changes.
- `git branch:` List, create, or delete branches.
- `git merge:` Merge changes from different branches.
- `git status:` Show the status of changes.

## Remote Repositories
- **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket:** Popular platforms for hosting Git repositories.
- `git remote:` Manage connections to remote repositories.
- `git fetch:` Download objects and refs from another repository.
- `git push:` Update a remote repository with local changes.

## Collaboration
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Proposed changes to a codebase that can be reviewed and merged.
- **Forks:** Creating a personal copy of another user's repository.
- `git blame:` Show changes made to a file and who made them.

## Branching Strategies
- **Feature Branches:** Create branches for specific features.
- **Git Flow:** A branching model for release management.
- **Pull Request Workflow:** Code review and collaboration using pull requests.

## Advanced Git
- **Rebase:** Combine a sequence of commits into a new base commit.
- **Cherry-pick:** Apply specific commits from one branch to another.
- **Git Hooks:** Custom scripts triggered by Git events.
- **Submodules:** Include other Git repositories as subdirectories.

## Git Configurations
- **User Config:** Set user-specific configurations.
- **Repository Config:** Set configurations specific to a repository.
- **Git Aliases:** Create shortcuts for frequently used commands.

## Git GUI Tools
- **SourceTree, GitKraken, GitHub Desktop:** Visual interfaces for Git.

## Git Best Practices
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **.gitignore:** Exclude files and directories from version control.
- **Branch Naming Conventions:** Adopt a consistent naming convention for branches.

## Troubleshooting
- `git log:` Display the commit history.
- `git reset:` Unstage changes or reset to a previous commit.
- `git revert:` Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit.
